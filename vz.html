      <p class="eyeBrow">Details</p>
    
  <p>  In the summer of 2018, I interned on the Verizon app team. I while on the team I worked on uncovering opportunities for Verizon’s newly launched rewards program, VerizonUp. My first task of the summer was to create a unique way to for current Verizon customers to enroll in VerizonUp and/or spend their accumulated currencies. 

I spent time collaborating with the UX research team.  We spent a few days analyzing voice of customer data and chat bot entries.

Their chat bot data showed that some customers were looking for clarification on how the program worked - more specifically customer didn’t know how to redeem their rewards and were having a generally mediocre experience due to the rarest of the rewards was too difficult to redeem.
    </p>

          <p class="eyeBrow">opportunity comes in disguise</p>
    <p>The voice of customer data showed there was also increasing amount of users who wanted to immediately redeem their currencies. For example. VerizonUp offered 5 dollar gift cards to users. Unfortunately these card could only be redeemed as physical cards. This was a very clear opportunity  for VerizonUp. It was clear that a large majority of the users were looking to redeem their rewards digitally and quickly. for the remainder to my internship, i decided to focusing on a feature that would help a user redeem their rewards quickly. I decided to focus creating a feature that would help users who engaged Verizon’s chat bot. </p>
           <img   src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4oijzrndbvbwiw5/vz3.jpg?raw=1" >
    <p>This concept came to life after a  brainstorming session with the VerizonUp design team. While on the chat bot screen, keywords related to redeeming rewards are to trigger a VerizonUp widget where a user could redeem their rewards without ever having to navigate through additional screens. Unfortunately, discussions with the chat bot team made it clear this feature would be resource heavy due to it’s back-end complexity. On the bright side, my experiments and research on VerizonUp’s support chat bot showed that it was completely different from the primary chat bot found the Verizon website. Thus, I proposed to my team that we need focus our efforts on updating and improving VerizonUp’s support chat bot in order to have a the two bots unified or at least have the appropriate infomration</p>
