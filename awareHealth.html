      <h2>Diving Deeper</h2>
      <div class="phaseDetails">

        <p>To develop a few ideas, we conducted addtiontal inteviews to learn more about lawyer assistance programs
          (LAPs) and
          their effectiveness. We conducted 100 interviews where we learned that peer focused solutions AAA and 12-step
          programs have low attendance and minimal long term effectiveness because of:</p>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Perceieved inconveniences such as long commutes. </li>
          <li>Perceived little value for lawyers who believed their conditions werenâ€™t severe</li>
          <li> Too few follow-up opportunities and little accountability for improvement.</li>

        </ol>
        <div class="userQuote">
          <p>"They are simply a huge waste of time. Who has time for these things?"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="userQuote">
          <p>"I feel like the [LAPs] don't really know who I am. It feels transactional."</p>
        </div>

<br>
<br>
<br>

        <h3>the inital idea</h3>
        <p>Our idea was to make an app that lawyers could use in parallel to LAP meetings help to reduce inconveniences
          and create accountability. We
          would increase accountability by introducing a virtual assistant to help with difficult concepts. We also
          chose to include bite-sized tasks for lawyers to complete at any pace to help reduce time concerns. </p>


      </div>



      <!--     Testing + validation -->
      <article class="projectPhase">
        <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
        <div class="phaseDetails">
          <p>To test our whether our idea was viable, I created a series of low fidelity wireframes. Which we
            shared with lawyers, wellness experts, and LAP organizers </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="phaseDetails">
          <h3>new insights</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>A purely AI guided experience didn't resonate well with lawyers. "what't the point of the assistant?"
            </li>
            <li>Lawyers were curious to see what other users were doing in the app. This is because LAP meetings usually
              have in-person participants who can offer additional perspectives.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

      </article>
      <!--     the solution -->
      <article class="projectPhase">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <div class="phaseDetails">
          <p>In our most recent iteration, we've decided to lean further into the peer to peer aspects of wellness to
            emulate the in-person LAP meetings. We also chose to reduce the presence of the virtual assistant. In
            addition to incorporating feedback from lawyers; we spent time learning from wellness experts about
            measuring an individual's progress as they use the app.
          </p>
          <br>
          <P>As a result, we created AwareHealth, A mental wellness app for lawyers which focuses on community building
            and AI guided resilience training to aid with Lawyer Assistant Programs.</p>
