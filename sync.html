      <p class="eyeBrow">Details</p>
      <p>SyncHealth is a patient to provider digital solution designed to keep patients personally engaged and informed in between their appointments.</p>
<p class="eyeBrow">Research</p>
       <p>1 in 10 therapy patients drop out of their scheduled appointments. </p><br>
<br>
    <p>Question: Why are there so many no-shows? </p>
<br>
<p>100 patient sided interviews revealed that patients didn’t feel engaged with their therapist. </p>
<br>
<p>“They didn’t really know me.”  was a common phrase in our interviews. </p>
<br>
<p>Interviews with providers like Mount Sinai revealed inconsistencies with current patient intake processes.</p>
<br>
<p>“It’s a big waste of time. You have to open so many different pages and they take forever to load.” was a common phrase from our provider side interviews. </p>
      
      <p class="eyeBrow">Synthesis</p>
      <p> From our interviews, we are derived from two areas of need for both patients and providers.</p><br>

<p>Patients need to have a personal connection to their therapist; the more information a therapist can cite the better. Patients also need to feel like their relationship continues beyond their scheduled appointments— as topics from their sessions can linger or are left unaddressed.</p>
<br>
<p>Providers need a to keep drop out rates low by engaging with their patients on a personal level. They also need a quick and efficient method of accessing each patient’s information while respecting privacy.

      <img class="ppictures" src="http://gdurl.com/RT-V"  alt= "Interactive screens for SyncHealth with a Voice UI"  width = "100%">
       <p>We created an engaging and intuitive line of products for both the patients and providers.</p>

<img class="ppictures" src="http://gdurl.com/v0kl" alt= "Screens for SyncHealth showcasing Moodscales" width = "100%">

<p>One is designed to be a non-intrusive application that assists with a patient's intake process. Which also serves as a catalyst for patient and therapist interaction by providing simple exercises and techniques that help patients feel engaged.</p>

<img class="ppictures" src="http://gdurl.com/BT9q" alt= "Screens for SyncHealth showcasing a patient dashboard" width = "100%"> 
<p>The other product is focused on the intake process. It is designed to display data as efficiently as possible. This high efficiency also ensures snappy load times between pages.</p>


<p class="eyeBrow">Next Steps</p>
<p>Design and Create solutions that further emphasize our quick and effective methods of engagement while adopting a none intrusiveapproach. Apple Watch or voice interfaces like the Alexa devices show promise for future development.</p>
