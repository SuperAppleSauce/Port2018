<p>NYU Classes is a digital platform designed to help faculty provide course materials and lessons for students. </p>


<p>Unfortunately, it is often described as:</p>

<p>“Broken, confusing, frustrating, boring, old, and ugly.”</p>

<p>It was clear to me that this needed to change.</p>


<p>Thanks to the collaborative nature of the W.R. Innovation Labs, I was able to meet like-minded individuals who also wanted to see change. </p>



<p>Our first discovery was that each course could be customized using HTML and CSS.</p>



<p>Shortly after discovering this, we approached professors who primarily taught online classes and found that there was indeed a demand for customized course site.</p>

<p>We also learned that NYU Stern had been wanting to expand its online education programs. Thus, we focused our efforts on redesigning courses taught online. </p>



<p>After a phone interview with a visually impaired student, we realized that our designs had to be usable and accessible to everyone in the community. </p>


<p>Additionally, after receiving our first client, we realized that redesigning the entirety of the site would be no easy task. We learned that the CMS provider, Sakai, was constantly under development and didn’t allow the use of any JavaScript. </p> 



<p>Despite this obstacle, we found clever, accessible and scalable solutions that allowed us to transform NYU classes into something that is:</p>



<p>“Reliable, clear, inspiring, professional, modern, and beautiful.”</p>



<p>We have also enabled community members to share their new course sites to peers and colleagues. <p>As a result, we have caught the attention of the online education community at NYU and are in the process of applying our design solutions across many NYU departments.</p>

<p>Over the past 2.5 years, my role on this project has evolved from a developer/designer role to a more product manager / technical consultant role. </p>



<p>Initially, it was my role to design and develop web solutions without the use of Javascript. This proved to be extremely difficult as each course had varying amounts of interactivity. I would often orchestrate meetings with the creators of Sakai in order to help my team understand their development process and our own constraints.</p>

<p>
Today, I co-lead a small team of designers, developers, and education technologists.  </p>
